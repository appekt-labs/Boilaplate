Creating a robust Next.js template that includes common features can significantly speed up the development process for SaaS and micro-SaaS products. Here are some ideas for repetitive tasks and features you can include in your template:

1. **Authentication and User Management**:
   - JWT authentication
   - OAuth integration (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub)
   - Password reset and email verification workflows
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)

2. **API Integration**:
   - REST and GraphQL setup
   - API rate limiting and caching
   - Error handling and logging

3. **Database Integration**:
   - ORM setup (e.g., Prisma, TypeORM)
   - Common CRUD operations
   - Database migrations

4. **Styling and UI Components**:
   - Pre-configured CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., styled-components, Emotion)
   - Common UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, modals)
   - Theme support and theming system

5. **State Management**:
   - Setup for popular state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Recoil)
   - Global state management patterns

6. **Form Handling**:
   - Form validation and handling (e.g., using Formik, React Hook Form)
   - Common form components (e.g., input fields, dropdowns, date pickers)

7. **Internationalization (i18n)**:
   - Multi-language support
   - Locale switching

8. **Error and Loading States**:
   - Consistent error handling patterns
   - Loading spinners and skeletons

9. **Testing Setup**:
   - Unit testing (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library)
   - Integration and end-to-end testing (e.g., Cypress)

10. **SEO and Performance Optimization**:
    - Meta tags and Open Graph tags
    - Image optimization
    - Lazy loading and code splitting

11. **Analytics and Monitoring**:
    - Integration with Google Analytics, Segment, or similar tools
    - Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)

12. **DevOps and Deployment**:
    - Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) setup
    - Docker configuration
    - Deployment scripts for popular platforms (e.g., Vercel, AWS, Netlify)

13. **Notification System**:
    - Email notifications setup
    - In-app notifications
    - Push notifications (web and mobile)

14. **Payment Integration**:
    - Integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
    - Subscription management

15. **File Uploads**:
    - File upload handling (e.g., images, documents)
    - Integration with cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3)

Including these features in your template will help streamline the development process and ensure that common functionalities are implemented consistently across projects.
